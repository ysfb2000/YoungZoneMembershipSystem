YoungZone â€“ Membership Management System

YoungZone was a chain restaurant enterprise for which I developed a custom membership management system.

The project followed a Client-Server architecture:

The client-side was built using a WinForms application for staff to manage member information and transactions.

The server-side was implemented as a web service, which interacted with a SQL Server database to handle data storage and retrieval.

This system included core features such as:

Member registration and profile management

Points tracking and rewards

Transaction history

Basic analytics and reporting

The project was developed several years ago. Since YoungZone has since ceased operations, I have made the source code available on GitHub for reference and learning purposes.
